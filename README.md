Aim: The purpose of this repository is to describe the process of creating a clean text file using the Smartphones Dataset

Contents: Codebook.txt (documents the variables), Readme.md (this file), Run_analysis.R (script to produce tidydataset)

Objectives of the script:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


run_analysis.R will work as long as the dataset is saved as a folder within your working directory
